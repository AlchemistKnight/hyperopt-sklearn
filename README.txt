hyperopt-sklearn
================

Hyper-parameter optimization for machine learning algorithms in sklearn.

This project builds primarily on:

    hyperopt: http://jaberg.github.com/hyperopt/

    sklearn: http://scikit-learn.org/


This project exists to use hyperopt [1] to optimize various sklearn algorithms
[2], and even groups of algorithms. It is very much an experiment, and a work
in progress. There is currently no documentation, and it is not yet ready for
end-users.
